## Optimizing Portfolio Weights with Theory and Machine Learning

This repository contains the report, poster, and code related to the project **Optimizing Portfolio Weights with Theory and Machine Learning**. This project explores portfolio optimization through theoretical models and machine learning techniques, tailored for investors with varying risk tolerances.

### Contents
- **Report**: [Link to Report](./Report.pdf)
- **Poster**: [Link to Poster](./Poster.pdf)
- **Code**: All project code is provided in the `Jupyter Notebook` or the `HTML` folder which supports the portfolio optimization models discussed in the report.

### Overview
In this study, we examine two portfolio optimization approaches:
1. **Minimizing Portfolio Variance**: Focuses on reducing portfolio risk.
2. **Linear-Quadratic Preference**: Balances risk and return based on investor risk tolerance, as outlined in Mertonâ€™s Portfolio Problem.

Backtesting on real world data, including 21 technology stocks, demonstrates the performance of each method. We test scenarios with different transaction costs, rebalancing schedules, and short-selling constraints, aiming to provide practical insights for investors.

### Key Sections

1. **Introduction**: Background on portfolio optimization.
2. **Model Setup and Parameter Estimation**: Explains model assumptions and methods for estimating asset returns and covariance matrices.
3. **Optimization Techniques**
   - **Variance Minimization**: Focuses on low-risk allocations.
   - **Linear-Quadratic Preference**: Incorporates expected returns and investor risk aversion.
4. **Results**: Comparison of different strategies, analyzing scenarios with and without rebalancing and short selling.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarizes the findings and practical implications.

### Dependencies
Python (Key packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `cvxpy`)
